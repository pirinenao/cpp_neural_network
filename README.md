### ANN implementation in C++

This project implements a simple Forward Feeding Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset using C++. It includes functions for loading the dataset, forward propagation, and training with backpropagation.

## MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of labeled images of handwritten digits (0-9), which are commonly used for training and testing machine learning algorithms. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.

The MNIST files are not my property. If used in a paper, you'll need to cite the reference paper, as indicated in the official [website](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
